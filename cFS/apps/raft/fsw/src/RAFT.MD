RAFT CONSENSUS ALGORITHM

1. IF NO LEADER: (SOME MAY "CHEAT" and START WITH SET LEADER on NETWORK INITIALIZATION)
		RAFT FOLLOWERS TERM ++
		RAFT FOLLOWERS SELF-PROMOTE TO "RAFT CANDIDATE"
		RAFT LEADER ELECTION 
				IF (RAFT CANDIDATE recieve RPC_HB_LOG_SYNC_APPEND) && (RPC_TERM >= CANDIDATE_TERM)
					RAFT CANDIDATE reversion to RAFT FOLLOWER
				ELSE 
					RAFT CANDIDATES VOTE
					RAFT CANDIDATES RPC_REQUEST_VOTE
						IF (VOTES(RAFT CANDIDATE) >= {[1/2]VOTES(TOTAL CAST)}) 
								RAFT CANDIDATE ELECTED RAFT LEADER	(NEW)
								RAFT LEADER (NEW) send RPC_HB_LOG_SYNC_APPEND (CURRENT)
								RETURN STATUS (LEADER)
						ELSE
							GOTO 1

2. WHILE (TERM==TRUE):
		IF (UPDATE):
			RAFT FOLLOWER	 	send LOG_ACKNOWLEDGE_ENTRY	(NEXT)
			RAFT LEADER		 recieve LOG_ACKNOWLDGE_ENTRY	(NEXT)	
			RAFT LEADER			send LOG_SYNC_APPEND (CURRENT)
			RAFT FOLLOWERS	 recieve LOG_SYNC_APPEND (CURRENT)

		RAFT LEADER		 recieve HB_ACKNOWLDGE 	(NEXT)
		RAFT LEADER		  append NODE COUNT 			to RPC_HB_SYNC (CURRENT)
		RAFT LEADER			send RPC_HB_SYNC	(CURRENT)
		RAFT FOLLOWERS	 recieve RPC_HB_SYNC	(CURRENT)
		RAFT FOLLOWERS		send HB_ACKNOWLEDGE (NEXT) for RPC_HB_SYNC (CURRENT)

3.	IF (TERM_TIMEOUT):
		GOTO 1
