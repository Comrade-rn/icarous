# This YAML file contains a list of icarous test case scenarios
# Each scenario contains:
#   name: name of the scenario
#   waypoint_file: path to flight plan file to load (required)
#   geofence_file: path to geofence file to load (null if none)
#   parameter_file: path to icarous parameter file to load (null if none)
#   param_adjustments: a dictionary of icarous parameters to adjust
#                      allows making small param changes without a new file
#                      ex: {"ALERTING_TIME": 20} to adjust alerting time to 20
#   traffic: a list of traffic vehicles to load - format for each traffic is:
#            [range(m), bearing(deg), height(m), speed(m/s), heading(deg), verticalspeed(m/s)]
#   time_limit: time limit for the scenario (in seconds)
#   [planned_wps:] optional - list the waypoint ids that ownship should reach
#                  used to define successfull waypoint progress test condition
#                  (default is expect to reach all waypoints)
#   (file paths are relative to Icarous repository)
