# Guidance

Provides flight plan following functionality to autopilots that lack an inbuilt guidance and navigation functionality. There are several guidance modes:
- PRIMARY_FLIGHTPLAN mode : Used for following the primary mission flight plan.
- SECONFARY_FLIGHTPLAN mode : Used for following a secondary trajectory. Used to perform reroutes to avoid geofence/traffic constraints.
- POINT2POINT mode: Simple mode to fly to a fixed GPS coordinate.
- VECTOR mode: Used to follow a velocity vector.
- TAKEOFF mode: Initiate a takeoff sequence.
