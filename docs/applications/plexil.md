# Plexil

This app is a cFS wrapper around the NASA developed Plan Execution Interchange
Language (PLEXIL). The plexil app provides decision making
functionality in Icarous. Plexil obtains the conflict data from the available
monitors and makes appropriate requests to compute resolutions for available
conflicts. Once conflicts are resolved, the original mission is resumed.
Currently, plexil monitors for geofence conflicts, flight plan deviations and
traffic conflicts.
