# Traffic Monitor

The traffic monitor application uses the [DAIDALUS](https://github.com/nasa/wellclear) library and provides traffic alerting functionality. Traffic information is obtained from the traffic_t software bus messages. Alerting information is provided in the form of track, ground speed, altitude and vertical speed bands.
